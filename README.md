## Working with `my-wave-portal`
This project is a simple react app to demonstrate working with a solidity contract, found in the `my-wave-portal` repository. 

Whenever a new contract is deployed to Rinkeby, make sure to update the contract ID in `App.js`.

i.e.
```
const contractAddress = "0x491d6337193277C6DE2DffB69f9A04F903cbbCE7";
```
